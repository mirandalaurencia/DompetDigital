CodeIgniter 4 comes with a local development server, leveraging PHPâ€™s built-in web server with CodeIgniter routing. You can use the serve script to launch it, with the following command line in the main directory:

> php spark serve

This will launch the server and you can now view your application in your browser at http://localhost:8080.
